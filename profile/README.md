# Building the future of reliability and operational excellence 
The [Rootly AI Labs](https://rootly.com/ai-labs) is a fellow-led community designed to redefine reliability engineering. We develop innovative prototypes, create open-source tools, and produce research that’s shared to advance operational excellence standards.

## Some of our projects:
* [Burnout detector](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/rootly-burnout-detector-web): Detecting burnout risk in incident responder teams, using incident data, GitHub activity, and Slack communication patterns.
* [Rootly MCP server](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/Rootly-MCP-server): Bring incident response into your coding assistant with the Rootly MCP server. 
* [SREbench]([https://rootly.com/blog/classifying-error-logs-with-ai-can-deepseek-r1-outperform-gpt-4o-and-llama-3](https://rootly.com/blog/benchmarking-llms-for-sre-tasks-boosting-sonnet-4-5-performance-by-100)): A benchmark suite for testing how well LLMs perform on real-world SRE tasks. Think SWE-bench, but for reliability engineers.
* [Screen Sherpa](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/SRE-screen-sherpa): Prototype of an over-the-shoulder SRE AI assistant, this prototype is helping engineers make sense of the graph they are watching.

## About the AI Labs

The complexities of modern technology demand a paradigm shift in how we fundamentally approach reliability.

[Rootly](https://rootly.com/) began in 2021 by building a category-defining on-call and incident response platform, trusted by thousands, including Replit, NVIDIA, LinkedIn, and Figma.

Now, GenAI is simultaneously introducing new complexities and unlocking opportunities to redefine reliability forever.

To stay at the forefront of this transformation, we’re launching Rootly AI Labs—a dedicated initiative exploring uncharted territories such as cognitive fault prediction, quantum-inspired optimization, self-evolving autonomic digital infrastructure, and advanced digital twin simulations.

[Rootly AI Labs](https://rootly.com/ai-labs) operates as an open-source incubator, fostering collaboration, experimentation, and rapid prototyping. We're committed to ensuring our research benefits the entire community.

We're always eager to welcome new partners and fellows because we believe that together, we can go further, move faster, and push the boundaries of AI-driven reliability and operational excellence.
