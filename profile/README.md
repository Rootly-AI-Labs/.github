# Building The Future of Reliability and Operational Excellence

The [Rootly AI Labs](https://rootly.com/ai-labs) is a fellow-led community designed to redefine reliability engineering. We develop innovative prototypes, create open-source tools, and produce research that’s shared to advance the standards of operational excellence.

# Some of Our Projects
* [SRE-skills-bench](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/SRE-skills-bench): Can LLMs resolve real-world SRE Tasks? A benchmark testing LLMs on SRE-type tasks. Like SWE-bench, but for SREs.
* [On-Call Health](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/On-Call-Health): Detects potential signs of overwork in incident responders, which could lead to burnout.
* [Rootly MCP server](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/Rootly-MCP-server): Resolve production incidents in under a minute without leaving your IDE.
* [IncidentDiagram](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/IncidentDiagram): Generates a diagram highlighting what happened during an incident by ingesting the retrospective and associated codebase.

# About the Rootly AI Labs

[Rootly](https://rootly.com/) began in 2021 by building a category-defining on-call and incident response platform, trusted by thousands, including Replit, NVIDIA, LinkedIn, and Dropbox.

Now, GenAI is simultaneously introducing new complexities and unlocking opportunities to redefine reliability forever.

The Rootly AI Labs is a fellow-led community designed to redefine reliability engineering. We develop innovative prototypes, create open-source tools, and produce research that's shared to advance the standards of operational excellence.
