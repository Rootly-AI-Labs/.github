# Building the future of reliability and operational excellence

The [Rootly AI Labs](https://rootly.com/ai-labs) is a fellow-led community designed to redefine reliability engineering. We develop innovative prototypes, create open-source tools, and produce research that’s shared to advance the standards of operational excellence.

# Some of our projects:
* [SRE-skills-bench](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/SRE-skills-bench): Can Language Models Resolve Real-world SRE Tasks? A benchmark testing LLMs on SRE-type tasks. Like SWE-bench, but for SREs
* [On-Call Burnout Detector](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/On-Call-Burnout-Detector): Detects potential signs of overwork in incident responders, which could lead to burnout.
